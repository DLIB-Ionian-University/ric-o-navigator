        "Activity is a kind of Event. Activity is specifically used to designate purposeful human activity. Activity may be understood from two perspectives. First it can be understood as leading to an end. The end is the purpose of the Activity, or why the Activity is performed. Second, it can be understood in terms of the processes that lead to achieving the end, how the end is realized through coordinated actions. Purpose and process are complementary understandings of Activity. Together the two perspectives address why the Activity is performed, the expected ends or outcomes; and how the Activity fulfills the purpose. While activity has an intended end, it also has unintended consequences and results, or side-effects. By and large, these may not be the focus of the description, but they are, unquestionably, context. |In a corporate or government context an Activity may also be called a 'function'. An Activity exists in a specific social and cultural context, and within that context is subject to change over time. An Activity may be composed of other Activities."

        "A Record or Record Part must have been instantiated at least once, though this instantiation may no longer exist at the moment of description. An instantiation might also exist at the moment of description, but be destroyed at a later moment in time, when, for example, a derived instantiation might become the only remaining instantiation. A Record Set may have an instantiation, which is to say that it is not a necessary condition. An Instantiation may be derived from another Instantiation. A Record Resource may have many Instantiations simultaneously (for instance, a record printed and saved in the same time as DOCX and PDF/A would have 3 concurrent instantiations) or through time (for example, copy of a record). Depending on the context, a new instantiation may be seen as a new or as the same record resource. During in the process of re-instantiation something is lost and something is preserved, but it is up to the context and the Agent that produces or uses that Instantiation to assess whether the two instantiations are functionally equivalent or not. For instance, a postcard representing a town map from 1874 (Instantiation 1) is digitized and kept as a JPEG file (Instantiation 2). The digital copy may be considered as instantiating the \"same\" Record by an Agent considering the information transmitted by the Record (e.g., the urban landscape displayed), but as a\" different\" Record by an antiquarian more focused on the materiality of the carrier. Successive instantiations may change the perceivable boundaries of a Record Resource. For instance, a case file comprising many records may be digitized and saved as one single PDF file, which, from management perspective, may be treated as one Record. Similarly, a large Record Set (a fonds or a series) may be maintained as one database. On the other hand, one record (main document and its annexes) may be digitized in separate files and each one may be managed as a discrete “physical” item. Instantiations may require mediation to communicate the information in the Record Resource. While a traditional Record on paper can simply be read by an Agent in order to understand the information, a vinyl recording, a video cassette or a digital file needs a device (mediator) to codify or decodify the information conveyed. This mediator may imply simple physical components (a turntable needle, for example), or a complex gallery of software and hardware elements. Instantiations are more than the mere informational content of Record Resource and may be the focus of preservation and physical management of records. The use of particular document types for records, such as a medieval charter, may have implications for the authenticity of the records. Hence, the way a Record Resource is instantiated contributes to the contextualizing of the content.record resource is instantiated contributes to the contextualizing the content. Distinguishing the message conveyed (Record Resource) and its physical representations (Instantiation) allows for the efficient management of their descriptions, and preserve information about a Record Resource even when no physical representation of it exists or is known to exist anymore. The relations between distinct instantiations can then be expressed wherever they coexist, and they can be related to the Record Resource they instantiate."

Mandates exist in a specific social and cultural context, and within that context are subject to change over time. While a mandate may be tacit, in whole or part, it may be explicitly expressed in a variety of documentary sources (for example, constitutions, legislation, (legal) acts, statutes, legal codes, ordinances, charges, charters, or mission statements). The evidence for identifying a mandate may be found in its entirety in one documentary source (for example, a law or regulation), or may be found in two or more sources. A mandate should not be confused with the one or more documentary sources that serve as evidence of its identity. A documentary source is a record."

Such \"alternative personae\" are most often created by the original person for specific purposes. The original persona may, in everyday discourse, be regarded as “the real person”. Under some circumstances, an alternative persona might eclipse or replace the original person (Mark Twain eclipsing Samuel Clemens; John Wayne eclipsing Marion Mitchell Morrison), that is, the alternative identity becomes the predominant identity. Less common is when two or more persons collaborate to create a shared persona. A persona shared by two or more persons constitutes a kind of group. Within the archival context, the description of a person commonly will focus on the original associated persona, with alternative personae noted. Exceptionally, an alternative persona may displace the original persona as the focus of the description. Under some circumstances, for example, when record resources are associated with two or more different personae of one person, describing the different personae as separate though related persons may be desirable. Alternatively, a person may change their identity over the course of their lifetime."

        "Record resource is a kind of Thing. Producing a record resource may imply either its initial creation or a reuse of previous existing information by combination, rearrangement, selecting, reformatting, etc. Record set, record, and record part are kinds of record resource. A record resource is evidence of the activity of an agent. More than one agent may be involved in the creation of a record resource. The role of the agent in creating the record resource may take different forms, for example, authoring of an individual record, accumulating a record set, or arranging a record set. Though a record, record set, and record part, under most circumstances, may be easily distinguished from one another, identifying the boundary of each may frequently present particular challenges. Documentary forms provide the rules governing the structure of many types of records, providing criteria for identifying a record's boundary, and identifying its essential parts. Many records, though, do not have well-established documentary forms, particularly in the case of digital records, where it may be difficult to determine whether individual elements represented in separate bitstreams are record parts, records, or record sets. For example, is photographic information represented independently in a bitstream embedded in a text document a record or a record part? Or is the same photographic information attached to an email that maintains its independent representation, a record or a record part? Information grouped for some purpose, for example, ZIP or TAR \"file compression\" for saving storage space, presents a further challenge. One file comprises multiple bitstreams subjected to techniques that remove bits that can be losslessly recovered when decompressed. Under what circumstances is such a compressed bitstream a record or a record set? Determining when an information object is a record, record set, or record part is based on perspective and judgement exercised in a particular context. In one context, the agent describing an information object may designate it a record, while another agent in a different context may designate it a record part. Both designations are supported by RiC-CM, and the significance of the difference for users of the records is ameliorated by the fact that all of the attributes and relations employed in describing record and record part are shared, as are many of the attributes and relations employed in describing a record set."

        "Record set is a kind of Record Resource. The member records in a Record Set may physically reside together, though physical proximity is not essential. In a particular context, an Agent (for example, administrator, records manager, archivist, end-user, etc.) may select the member records of a Record Set based on any shared attribute or attributes, or any shared relation or relations. The grouping of the records serves a purpose or purposes specific to the context of the Agent. For example, all member records of a Record Set have been accumulated by the same Agent; have the same Documentary Form Type; or are related to and document the same Activity. A Record Set may represent the act of classifying the records in accordance with a formal classification scheme that may be based on activity, subject, organizational structure, or other criteria; an act of archival arrangement (for example, based on common provenance); or some other selection and grouping that fulfils a particular purpose or purposes (for example, a classification that reflects or supports the purposes of a researcher). By exception, some records are brought together based on their not belonging in the context of selection to other designated groups: a 'Miscellaneous' series, for example. A Record Sset accumulated by an Agent in the course of life or work activity should be described in a manner that preserves context and evidential value. Record Sets may also contain other Record Sets. A Record Set or Record may simultaneously be a member of more than one Record Set, and over the course of its existence, a Record Set or Record may be a member of an indeterminate number of Record Sets in an indeterminate number of contexts. Record Sets and Records contained within a Record Set may be ordered into a sequence based on a common property or relation, or common properties or relations (for example, alphabetical by agent or related place); chronological order by creation date; or some other criterion (for example, an imposed order by relevance)."
